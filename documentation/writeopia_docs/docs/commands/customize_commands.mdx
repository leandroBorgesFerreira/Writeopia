# Customize Commands


Some of the `StoryStepDrawer` of Writeopia accept a `TextCommandHandler` to handle commands from text input. 
The default `TextCommandHandler` is already provided by `DefaultDrawers.create` and if you would like to change the default commands, changing the command handler of `DefaultDrawers.create` if the way to go. 

`DefaultDrawers` accepts `TextCommandHandler` in the constructor. You can provide a command handle with different commands. 

```kotlin
val command = Command("-> ", WhereToFind.START)

DefaultDrawers.create(
    editable = true,
    // Other configurations
    // [...]
    textCommandHandler = TextCommandHandler(
        mapOf(
            command to { _, position ->
                writeopiaManager.changeStoryType(
                    position,
                    StoryType("unordered_list_item", number = 100),
                    CommandInfo(
                        command,
                        CommandTrigger.WRITTEN
                    )
                )
            }
        )
    )
)
```

This will change the default unordered list item initial text to "-> " instead of "- ".
